## Technologies Used

The Dice Game app is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: The structure and layout of the web pages are created using HTML.

- **CSS**: CSS is used for styling the user interface and making the website visually appealing.

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is responsible for the functionality of the app, handling user interactions.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach 10 points. Each player takes turns rolling a dice and accumulating points based on the outcome. The game supports two players.

### Game Controls

The following buttons are available to control the game:

- **Roll Dice**: Clicking this button will roll the dice and generate a random number between 1 and 6. The number rolled will be added to the current player's points. If the dice rolls a 0, all the points accumulated by the current player will be lost, and the turn will be switched to the other player.

- **Hold**: By clicking this button, the current player decides to hold their current points. The accumulated points will be added to the player's total score, and the turn will be switched to the other player.

- **New Game**: Clicking this button will start a new game. It will reset all the scores and set the current player to the first player.

### Winning the Game

The game continues until one of the players reaches or exceeds 100 points. The first player to reach this score is declared the winner. Once a player wins, the game is concluded, and players can choose to start a new game if desired.
